**Country Life Expectancy Dataset Analysis**

**Overview**

This project analyzes the life expectancy at birth across various countries over several years, along with their respective GDPs. The goal is to uncover insights into how life expectancy correlates with GDP and to explore other potential relationships within the data.

**Dataset**

The dataset contains the following columns:

Country: The name of the country.

Year: The year of the recorded data.

Life expectancy at birth (years): The average number of years a newborn is expected to live.

GDP: The Gross Domestic Product of the country.

**Key Analyses and Findings**

Life Expectancy by Country:

Computed and visualized the life expectancy at birth for each country over the years.
Presented average life expectancy across all years by country.

Life Expectancy by GDP:

Analyzed and visualized the relationship between life expectancy and GDP.
Created a matrix to visualize each country's life expectancy by GDP.

Correlation Matrix:

Converted the 'Country' column into dummy variables to perform a correlation matrix.
Visualized the correlation matrix to understand the relationships between different countries' life expectancies and GDPs.

Data Preprocessing:

Converted GDP values to integers for accurate analysis.
Created dummy variables for the 'Country' column to facilitate correlation analysis.

**Visualizations**

The following visualizations were created to support the analysis:

Life Expectancy by Country: Bar charts showing the life expectancy at birth for each country.

Life Expectancy vs GDP: Scatter plots and line charts illustrating the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.

Correlation Matrix: Heatmap of the correlation matrix with dummy variables for countries to identify significant relationships.

**Presentation**

The summarizations and key findings from the analysis were compiled and presented in a PowerPoint presentation. This presentation includes:

Visualizations highlighting the trends and relationships in the data.

Key insights and potential implications of the findings.

Recommendations for further analysis or action based on the data.

**Conclusion**

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the life expectancy and GDP data, uncovering significant insights into the relationship between economic conditions and health outcomes across different countries. The findings presented in the PowerPoint provide a clear and concise summary of the results, offering valuable information for further research and decision-making.
